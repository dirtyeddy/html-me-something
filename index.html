                <p>There are several snake species around the St. Louis area, most of which are harmless, except for the timber rattlesnake and the copperhead. 
                    Most of these species are quite secretive and are seldom seen.
                    They tend to spend most of their time hidden under rocks and cover and usually come out only to bask or to hunt at night.
                    Over the past years I have been able to see several examples of the species listed bellow. 
                    Here are some pictures I took of the highlights of several of my favorite snake species I've encountered around the area over the last few years.<br>

                <p>Here is another snake that is commonly found under small rocks along rocky wooden hillsides.</p>

              <br>
              These snakes are one of the smallest fossorial snakes in the area, and almost never surfice above ground.</figcaption>

            <p>One of my favorite snakes in the area that I don't see very often is this little arborial snake:</p>

            <img src="images/roughgreen.jpg">
            <figcaption><b>Rough Green Snake</b> <i>Opheodrys aestivus</i><br><br>
                Rough Green Snakes are not that rare, but are seldom seen because of they spend nearly all their time in trees and overhanging vegetation around 
                bushes near water. This individual was found on the crawl in the middle of an open glade in the early spring.

            <p>One of the most recognizable and feared snakes in the area is this guy.</p>

            <img src="images/timber.jpg">
            <figcaption><b>Timber Rattlesnake</b> <i>Crotalus horridus</i><br><br>
                Timber Rattlesnakes are one of the most impressive and feared snakes in the area. Though their venom is dangerous, they 
                are often shy and secretive, and try to avoid human interaction at all costs. 
                This guy was found basking outside its hibernaculum in a park in western St. Louis County.<br></figcaption>

            <p>One of the most interesting and uncommon snakes in the area is the hognose snake.</p>

            <img src="images/hog.jpg">
            <figcaption><b>Eastern Hognose Snake</b> <i>Heterdon platirinos</i><br><br>
                Hognose snakes generally like dry areas with loose or sandy soil. They have an interesting display
                when threatened, where they spread their hood and hiss loudly, and if that doesn't deter
                a predator, they flip over and play dead like a possum. Although they are rear-fanged,
                their venom is only harmful against toads, and harmless to humans.<br></figcaption>

            <figcaption><b>Red-bellied Snake</b> <i>Storeria occipitamaculata</i><br><br>
                Red-bellied snakes are very seldom seen, they are small snakes that spend most of their time hidden
                under leaf litter on the forest floor. I found this guy on the bottom of the a densely wooded hillside.<br></figcaption>

            <figcaption><b>Speckled Kingsnake</b> <i>Lampropeltis getula holbrooki</i><br><br>
                Speckled Kingsnakes are a common resident throughout the Ozark hills, and their range comes into 
                the southern portion of St. Louis County. This guy was found basking in a rock pile after an afternoon rain
                one early summer day. Kingsnakes often consume other snakes, even venomous ones, but prefer to snack on rodents when given the choice.<br></figcaption><br>
